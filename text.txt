Digital Assets Standalone - Status Update
                                                                                                                                                                                  
  Terraform script is complete and working:
  - 10 resources deployed successfully (TokenizationStack, CustodyStack, WalletManager, AssetManager, ERC20 Indexer, KMS Wallet/Key)
  - Infrastructure is ready

  Additional configuration needed (outside Terraform scope):
  - Register ERC20 contract interface in FireFly
  - Create Smart Contract API in FireFly
  - Configure asset with transfer flow in WalletManager
  - These are runtime/middleware configurations, not infrastructure

  Need more time to complete the end-to-end transfer demo - this requires additional setup beyond the Terraform script.

  What's ready to show:
  - Terraform deployment (terraform apply)
  - Created stacks, services visible in Kaleido Console
  - WalletManager API (wallets, assets, backends)
  - AssetManager API (pools, addresses)
